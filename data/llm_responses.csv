    Constraint: Return ONLY a valid JSON object containing a list of findings. The ""Category"" must be one of the following: ""Critical Vulnerability"", ""Minor Warning"", ""Dependency Issue"", ""Security Enhancement"", ""Compliance Adherence"". Do not include markdown formatting (like ```json). 
    
    Given text:
    ""During a recent security audit, it was discovered that the application's encryption module does not use the recommended AES-256 standard, which could potentially expose sensitive data. The module currently implements AES-128, which is considered less secure. The development team"

Raw Input:
The database migration script was updated to version 3.4.1, but it's been noted that this version fails to implement proper input validation, potentially allowing SQL injection attacks. Additionally, there are undocumented features that could expose sensitive data if not handled correctly.

###
Constraint: Create a JSON object summarizing the security issues identified, ensuring each point is categorized correctly and includes a confidence score and reasoning. Do not add any extraneous information.

You are a Security Researcher.

1. Check if it exists on PyPI.
2. Search for any known security advisories on GitHub or NVD.
3. Synthesize your findings into a brief security report.



Summary: A simple framework for building complex web applications.
Version: 3.1.2
Author: None

**Check if 'flask' package is available on PyPI**

The Flask package exists and can be installed using pip:
```
pip install flask
```","['check_pypi_metadata', 'check_github_advisories', 'check_nvd_cves']"
django,"The Python package ""django"" has been found to have a known security advisory.

**Security Report:**

Django version `6.x` is vulnerable due to an SQL injection issue, which affects earlier versions of the framework (5.0 and 4.2). This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries by manipulating column aliases in certain situations.

To mitigate this risk:

*   Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation when building database requests.
*   Ensure that all input data is properly sanitized before being used with the `django.db.models` API or other ORM functions.","['check_pypi_metadata', 'check_github_advisories', 'check_nvd_cves']"
pyyaml,"The Python package `pyyaml` has been found to have a vulnerability in its version prior to 5.3.1 that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code when processing untrusted YAML files.

This is due to the improper input validation of PyYAML, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if it processes untrusted data through certain methods such as `full_load` or using a specific loader like FullLoader in conjunction with full load. This vulnerability has been identified by Mitre Corporation and classified as CVE-2017-18342.

To address this issue, users should ensure they are running the latest version of PyYAML (5.x) to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, developers can implement proper input validation when working with YAML data from untrusted sources or use a more secure approach such as using an external library like `yaml-cold` which is designed for cold storage and has better security features.

It's essential to note that this vulnerability affects all versions of PyYAML prior to 5.3.1, so users should apply the necessary patches immediately if they are still on earlier versions or have unpatched systems in place.","['check_pypi_metadata', 'check_github_advisories', 'check_nvd_cves']"
